# Hello-World
### Learning Git
### Currently learning: 
- **Python** 
- **PHP** 
- **C++**

The *goal*, is to be able to write `Hello world` in every language.
Not very *complicated*, I know, but start small?
Anyway here's my first one,
 
    >>> print("Hello world!")
    
...And while we're at it,
    
    <?php
    
    echo "Hello world!";
    
    ?>
Let's throw this in too

    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() 
    {
        std::cout << "Hello world!";
        
        return 0;
    }
